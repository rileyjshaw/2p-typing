  [ "All my life, I've wanted to see snow. My name is Jordan Blake. My life has been twelve years of sun, sand, and chlorine. I'd never felt cold, ever—unless you count air-conditioned supermarkets. And I don't. It doesn't snow in the supermarket. I'd never felt cold, that is, until the adventure. Some people think I'm a lucky guy to live in Pasadena, California, where it's always sunny and warm. It's okay, I guess. But if you've never seen snow, it seems like something out of a science-fiction movie. Fluffy white frozen water that falls out of the sky? It piles up on the ground, and you can make forts and snowmen and snowballs out of it? You have to admit it sounds weird. One day, my wish came true. I got to see snow at last. And it turned out to be weirder than I thought. Way weirder. \"Pay attention, kids. This is going to be cool.\" Dad's face glowed under the red darkroom light. My sister, Nicole, and I watched him developing film. With a pair of tongs, he dipped a sheet of special paper in a chemical bath. I've watched Dad develop film all my life. He's a professional photographer. But I'd never seen him so excited about photos before—and that's saying a lot. Dad takes nature photos. Well, actually, he takes pictures of everything! He never stops taking pictures. My mom says that once when I was a baby I saw Dad and screamed. I didn't recognize him without a camera in front of his face."
  , "Anyway, Dad had just returned from a trip to the Grand Tetons. That's a mountain range in Wyoming—part of the Rocky Mountains. He was all worked up about the pictures he took there. \"I wish you kids had seen those bears,\" Dad said. \"A whole family of them. The cubs reminded me of you two—always teasing each other.\" Teasing. Ha. Dad thinks Nicole and I tease each other. That's putting it mildly. Nicole—Miss Know-it-all—drives me crazy. Sometimes I wish she'd never been born. I've made it my mission to make her feel the same way. I mean, I try to make her wish she'd never been born. \"You should have taken us with you to the Grand Tetons, Dad,\" I complained. \"It's very cold in Wyoming this time of year,\" Nicole said. \"How do you know, Brainiac?\" I jabbed her in the ribs. \"You've never been to Wyoming.\" \"I read up on it while Dad was away,\" she explained. Of course. \"There's a picture book about it in the library if you want to know more, Jordan. It's just right for you—it's for first graders.\" I couldn't think of anything to say back. That's my problem. I'm too slow with the comebacks. So I jabbed her again."
